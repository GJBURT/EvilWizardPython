# Advanced Python Module Project: Defeat the Evil Wizard

Project Overview
In this mini-project, you will create a hero character and battle the powerful Evil Wizard. You'll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to extend starter code, customize your character, and add new functionality. Through a simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats. Your task is to modify the starter code and defeat the Evil Wizard by implementing your own logic and design.

âœ¨ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students will be able to:
âœ… Understand OOP Principles: Practice inheritance, methods, and interactions between objects in Python.
âœ… Build Interactive Programs: Implement a menu system for a turn-based game.
âœ… Design Game Logic: Manage attacks, healing, and enemy interactions to make gameplay dynamic.


Defeat the Evil Wizard is a Turn Based game where a selected Hero will trade blows with the Evil Wizard. Will you succeed in defeating the Evil Wizard?!

Character Classes:
1. Warrior
2. Mage 
3. Archer
4. Paladin
5. Necromancer
6. Rogue

End User Flow: Choose your Hero's Character Class > Enter a Name for your Hero > Select between 6 options on your turn (1. Attack, 2. Special Ability, 3. Unique Ability, 4. Heal, 5. View Stats, 6. Exit the game) > The Evil Wizard will automatically regenerate health and attack after each turn.

Programming Languges:
Python
